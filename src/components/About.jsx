          Hello Everyone and Thank you for taking the time to visit my Website! <br/>
          A little bit about me, myself & I .....
    
        </p>

        <br />

        <p className="text">
          I'm Grishma and I am currently working as a Software Developer for a bank based in London, UK and I mainly use JavaScript and Python in my current profession. I also have another weapon of choice which is Cyber Security which I studied in University where I applied theoretical and practical exercises of Enterprise Security and Cyber Governance, both which plays a huge role in safeguarding our infrastructures.
           <br/><br/>Building web applications using JavaScript, React.js, HTML & Tailwind CSS is what I really enjoy doing as I love to see results displayed aesthetically. I have recently also discovered an adimration for Python and have built serveral mini projects which are in my Portfolio section of this website. <br/> 
          
          
          <br/>Tenacity and  Curiousity are traits I aim to constanty develop when I am programming as Coding is a lifelong learning path and there is always a way to constantly optimize your programs. <br/> Furthermore, a collabarative and social environment where individuals are able to bounce off each other's ideas is where I enjoy working alongside the most:  As they say - Team Work makes the Dream Work!


    <br/><br/>
    Outside of Coding, I love to hit the Gym daily and play my guitar as a way of relieving stress after a long session of debugging a single syntax error....which probably explains my sudden interest in Python.
    Oh yeah, Did i mention I also have an unhealthy obsession for Cookies and Boba Tea ?
